Ex1: 
r  <-  ssn G count-distinct(especialidade)->num_especialidades ( consulta ⨝c.nif=m.nif  medico )
r  ⨝  G max(num_especialidades) (r) 



Ex2: Which is the medical specialty with more appointments? (???)

Ex3: Please write an SQL query that identifies which patients have multiple appointments (more than one) scheduled for the same day. Bearing in mind that the database is structured across two tables: 'patient' (with two columns: Nº_SS and name) and 'appointment' (with two columns: Nº_SS and date).
